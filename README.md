### 4. Configure GitHub Actions ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Set Up GitHub Actions Workflows**:
   Ensure that the workflow files are correctly configured in the `.github/workflows` directory. Customize these files as needed for your specific requirements.

## Usage üöÄ

After setting up the repository and workflows, GitHub Actions will automatically handle the tasks defined in the workflow files. You can monitor and manage the workflows from the GitHub Actions tab in your GitHub repository.

### Running Actions üîÑ

- **Automatic Triggers**: Workflows will run automatically based on events like pushes, pull requests, or scheduled triggers.
- **Manual Triggers**: You can also manually trigger workflows from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Configuration of GitHub Actions can be done via the workflow YAML files located in the `.github/workflows` directory. Customize these files according to your project's needs.

### Key Configuration Files üìÑ

- **`.github/workflows/main.yml`**: Main workflow file for automated tasks.
- **`.github/actions/setup.sh`**: Script for setting up the environment.

### Example Workflow: SSH Deployment üîß

The following is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying code to a server using SSH:

```yaml
name: add_ssh_deploy_server.yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to server (lokasbot)
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
          request_pty: true
          script_stop: true
          key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
          script: |
            become lokasbot sh -c "rm -rf action_temp; git clone https://github.com/LokasWiki/actions.git action_temp; chmod +x action_temp/lokasbot/pull.sh; action_temp/lokasbot/pull.sh"
            become lokasbot2 sh -c "rm -rf action_temp; git clone https://github.com/LokasWiki/actions.git action_temp; chmod +x action_temp/lokasbot2/pull.sh; action_temp/lokasbot2/pull.sh"
```

This workflow will deploy the latest changes from the `main` branch to the specified servers using SSH. It ensures that the code is up-to-date and ready for use.
